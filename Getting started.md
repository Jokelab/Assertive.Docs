# Let's get going
This page has a little tutorial to get familiar with Assertive Script.

## Install the VSCode extension

## Hello world!
Every language should start with a decent Hello world. Assertive is no exception:
```assertive
out "Hello world!";
```

# Our first HTTP request
An HTTP request always starts with a request method, such as GET or POST. 
```assertive
GET "https://www.my-api.com/v1/";
```
