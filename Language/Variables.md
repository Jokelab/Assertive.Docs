# Variables
Variables are very common in every programming language. Assertive supports variables to enable temporary storage of information during the execution of a script. 
A variable always starts with a dollar sign (**$**) and is followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, for example: 

```
$myVariable
```


# Syntax of an an assignment statement
```
[variable] = [expression];
```

## Examples

```
$x = "value for x"; //x will be a string
$y = 1337; //y will be numeric
```
