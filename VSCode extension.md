# VSCode extension
To simplify Assertive Script development, a Visual Studio Code extension has been published to the marketplace.
The extension supports:
- Syntax highlighting
- A command to call the Assertive interpreter. Keyboard shortcut: ctrl+alt+a or shift+cmd+a on Mac.
- An output window tailored for Assertive script
- Code snippets to speed up development
- A Language Server Protocol (LSP)[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/] implementation that analyses the script to report syntax and semantic errors
