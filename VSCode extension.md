# VSCode extension
To simplify Assertive Script development, a Visual Studio Code extension has been created with the following features:
The extension supports:
- Syntax highlighting.
- A command to call the Assertive interpreter. Keyboard shortcut: ctrl+alt+a on Windows and Linux or shift+cmd+a on macOS.
- An output window tailored for Assertive script.
- Code snippets to speed up development.
- A Language Server Protocol ([LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) implementation that analyses the script. Any discovered errors will be reported in the Problems window.
